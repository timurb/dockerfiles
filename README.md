This is a repository of some experimental images for [Docker](http://www.docker.io/) I create while playing with some software.

The images should not be considered production-ready unless this is stated explicitly.

There could be some dockerfiles copypasted from internet -- these ones are (c) by their authors and these should usually
have copyright info inside them.
